Hello. I am Stefan, a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of Innsbruck. I love doing research work and tinkering with software. I specialize in computational physics, specifically in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). I am experienced in dealing with partial differential equations.

On physics topics, I specialize in computational physics with application in astrophysics and general (magneto)hydrodynamics. Main interest are the cosmic ray transport in the Galaxy, supernova core-collapse mechanisms, black hole accretion and nuclear fusion. Current work pertains to continuous development of the [PICARD code](https://www.uibk.ac.at/astro/research_groups/ralf-kissmann/home/picard-code.html.en), a cosmic ray propagation code.

On the technical side of things as a software developer I specialize in [mathematical modelling](https://www.mathscareers.org.uk/what-is-mathematical-modelling/), [numerical analysis](https://www.britannica.com/science/numerical-analysis) and [data analysis](https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/n_illinois_u/datamanagement/datopic.html). Recently started going through LeetCode problems and I am loving them all.

Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie PhD research fellow of the DOCC programme via the HORIZON2020 initiative.
